## Rubiks-Cube-Scrambler

# About
This is a Rubik's cube scrambler that I made in C. You have to have a compiler installed in order to run this file. 
You can download a compiler for windows at https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/
On windows, you should also have the \bin folder in the mingw in your system PATH.

In the Makefile provided, you can use it in order to create the exe for the file. Just include it in the project directory, and if you are using mingw,
just use the command "mingw32-make", and in order to remove the object files, you can use "rm *.o". If you are not using mingw, you should be able to
just type "make"
